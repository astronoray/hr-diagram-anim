# hr-diagram-anim
Running this code will generate an animated Hertzsprung-Russell (HR) diagram. Stars will start out out their apparent V-band magnitudes and B-V colors and move to their absolute V-band magnitudes and B-V colors. 

Stars included in the stars.csv file are those stars that are either within 10 parsecs of the Sun, those that are bright in the sky up to 6.5 mags, or those that are intrinsically luminous. Each type is marked in the last column as "Near", "Bright", or "Luminous". Those stars that are both bright and nearby are marked as "Both". Also included in stars.csv are the technical and common names for each star, the V-band apparent magnitude, the distance in parsecs to the star, the absolute V-band magnitude, and B-V colors. All data was taken from SIMBAD.
